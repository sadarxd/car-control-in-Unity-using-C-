This code should provide basic car controls similar to those in Need for Speed games. The car will move forward or backward depending on the player's vertical input and turn left or right depending on their horizontal input.

However, it is important to note that this code is just a starting point and you may need to adjust the values of the speed and rotationSpeed variables to get the desired effect for your car.
